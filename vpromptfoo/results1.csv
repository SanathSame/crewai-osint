7. Have you traveled to Europe before, or is this your first time?

Once I have a better understanding of your preferences and budget, I can start suggesting some affordable options for you.

Additionally, I can offer some general tips for traveling on a budget in Europe:

* Consider visiting during the shoulder season (April-May or September-October) when prices are generally lower.
* Look for package deals that include flights and accommodations.
* Use public transportation instead of taxis or rental cars to save money.
* Eat at local cafes, food stalls, or street markets to try authentic cuisine at a fraction of the cost.
* Research free walking tours and cultural attractions in each city.
